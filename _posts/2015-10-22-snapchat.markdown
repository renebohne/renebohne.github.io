<p>I installed snapchat some years ago. I hate the user interface! But the new chat features are great. Now you can video chat with your friends and find interesting news in the discover section.
<br>I want to use snapchat more often and I need your help. Please add me on snapchat and share your stories and let's chat!

<h2>Add me</h2>
<p>Just open snapchat, target your camera on this snapcode and hold one finger on the snapcode:
