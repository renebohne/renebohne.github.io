<p>In 2013, I was a member of a small team that planned the first Mini Makerfaire in Kerkrade, Netherlands. It was hosted by the Continium Science Museum. I also had a big table for Fab Lab Aachen. The event was a huge success and much fun!</p>
<p>My friend Karsten Joost from Bermen managed to get the SolarSinter to Kerkrade! It is a piece of art by Markus Kayser. A 3D printer that uses sun light to melt sand! </p>
<p>The other highlight was the "strandbeest" by Theo Jansen. For this project, he uses evolutionary algortihms.</p>
