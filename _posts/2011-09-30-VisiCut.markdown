VisiCut is our free, open-source lasercutter software!

* Includes LibLaserCut, a platform independant library for Lasercutters (currently supporting the Epilog ZING, MINI and HELIX and Lasercutters with the LAOS board, but other drivers will follow in the near future)

* Currently supports SVG, EPS, DXF and the VisiCut PLF (Portable Laser Format)

* Get a preview how your graphic would look on the material

* Easy place your graphic on the target material using a camera preview

* Save your work and publish it in the VisiCut PLF-Format

* Prepare your laserjobs at home – no more surprises when importing your file in the FabLab
