At the moment, Simone Giertz is my favorite maker on YouTube! She has many great projects, but the best one is her breakfast machine:

Breakfast is the meal of the day that I miss too often. And of cource this is because I don't have a smart robot that feeds me!

Not going to happen. I’m self-aware enough to know I only make good decisions out of total desperation, and I wasn’t there yet.

This is what Simone writes in her article at Motherboard:

In this article, she gives us a step-by-step instruction that sounds too easy to build! I was part of the [robOLED]({% post_url 2014-10-10-RobOLED %}) project some years ago. We created our own 3D-printed robotic arm and I wonder if we should make a breakfast machine with this arm.
