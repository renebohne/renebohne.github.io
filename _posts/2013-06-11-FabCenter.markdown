I supervised this Diploma thesis by Tim Hemig.

## About

Fabcenter was a diploma thesis project by Tim Hemig at the media computing group.
In the context of open source hardware an the rising distribution of fablabs worldwide it gets more and more important to embrace usability, since not only hackers or early adopters are in the field. Fablabs aim at getting personal fabrication and design into your everyday business.
