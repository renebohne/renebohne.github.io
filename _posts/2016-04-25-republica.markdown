# Talk
On May 4th, 2016 at 10:30, I will give my second __talk on stage L__ at re:publica. In my talk, I will give an overview over my new job at Elektor, my research activities at RWTH Aachen University and technical details about the WEAR-LEDs project. I will talk about how to create the internet of textile things and how to synchronize costumes and clothes for smarter fashion. Learn how to control LEDs on your clothes with your smart phone and how to store sensor data from your smart fashion projects into the cloud.
