# Talk
On May 4th, 2016 at 10:30, I gave my second __talk on stage L__ at re:publica. I gave an overview over my new job at Elektor, my research activities at RWTH Aachen University and technical details about the WEAR-LEDs project. I also talked about how to create the internet of textile things and how to synchronize costumes and clothes for smarter fashion. Learn how to control LEDs on your clothes with your smart phone and how to store sensor data from your smart fashion projects into the cloud.

# Fishbowl
At 17:30, I was a member of the fishbowl about VR and fashion. I discussed with Lisa Lang, Gabriel Platt, and Anna Rojahn how VR can be used for fashion.
