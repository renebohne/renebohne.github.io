<p>As one station of the <a href="https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Mitch_UK_DE_Tour_2014" target="_blank">Mitch UK DE tour</a>, Mario Lukas and I were able to invite Mitch Altman to visit Aachen. Mitch came to the dorkbot Aachen meeting on May, 14, 2014 and gave a talk about success and failure. We recorded this talk and an exclusive interview that was moderated by Jan Borchers. I can offer you both recordings here:</p>
