On April 20th, 2016, I am part of a panel discussion about "Engaging with The Consumer Through Creating an Effective User Interface and Design".
We will talk about the user interface for Wearables and how to improve the user experience.

After the panel discussion, I will give a talk about "The Internet of Textile Things". In my talk, I will give an overview over my research activities at RWTH Aachen University and technical details about the WEAR-LEDs project. I will talk about how to create the internet of textile things and how to synchronize costumes and clothes for smarter fashion. Learn how to control LEDs on your clothes with your smart phone and how to store sensor data from your smart fashion projects into the cloud.
