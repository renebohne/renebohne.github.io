On April 20th, 2016, I was part of a panel discussion about "Engaging with The Consumer Through Creating an Effective User Interface and Design".
We talked about the user interface for Wearables and how to improve the user experience.

After the panel discussion, I gave a talk about "The Internet of Textile Things". In my talk, I gave an overview over my research activities at RWTH Aachen University and technical details about the WEAR-LEDs project. I talked about how to create the internet of textile things and how to synchronize costumes and clothes for smarter fashion. People learned how to control LEDs on clothes with a smart phone and how to store sensor data from smart fashion projects into the cloud.
